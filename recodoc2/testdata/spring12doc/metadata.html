}</pre><p>Both of these examples use Jakarta Commons Attributes syntax.</p><p>Source-level metadata was introduced to the mainstream by XDoclet
    (in the Java world) and by the release of Microsoft's .NET platform, which
    uses source-level attributes to control transactions, pooling and other
    behavior.</p><p>The value in this approach has been recognized in the J2EE
    community. For example, it's much less verbose than the traditional XML
    deployment descriptors exclusively used by EJB. While it is desirable to
    externalize some things from program source code, some important
    enterprise settings--notably transaction characteristics--arguably belong
    in program source. Contrary to the assumptions of the EJB spec, it seldom
    makes sense to modify the transactional characteristics of a method
    (although parameters like transaction timeouts might change!).</p><p>Although metadata attributes are typically used mainly by framework
    infrastructure to describe the services application classes require, it
    should also be possible for metadata attributes to be queried at runtime.
    This is a key distinction from solutions such as XDoclet, which primarily
    view metadata as a way of generating code such as EJB artefacts.</p><p>There are a number of solutions in this space, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Standard Java Annotations</b></span>: the
        standard Java metadata implementation (developed as JSR-175 and
        available in Java 5. Spring already supports specific Java 5
        Annotations for transactional demarcation, and for JMX. But we need a
        solution for Java 1.4 and even 1.3 too.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>XDoclet</b></span>: well-established
        solution, primarily intended for code generation</p></li><li><p>Various <span class="bold"><b>open source attribute
        implementations</b></span>, for Java 1.3 and 1.4, of which Commons
        Attributes appears to be the most promising. All these require a
        special pre- or post-compilation step.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="metadata-spring"></a>9.2.&nbsp;Spring's metadata support</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>In keeping with its provision of abstractions over important
    concepts, Spring provides a facade to metadata implementations, in the
    form of the <tt class="literal">org.springframework.metadata.Attributes</tt>
    interface.</p><p>Such a facade adds value for several reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Java 5 provides metadata support at language level, there will
          still be value in providing such an abstraction:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>Java 5 metadata is static. It is associated with a class
              at compile time, and cannot be changed in a deployed
              environment. There is a need for hierarchical metadata,
              providing the ability to override certain attribute values in
              deployment--for example, in an XML file.</p></li><li><p>Java 5 metadata is returned through the Java reflection
              API. This makes it impossible to mock during test time. Spring
              provides a simple interface to allow this.</p></li><li><p>There will be a need for metadata support in 1.3 and 1.4
              applications for at least two years. Spring aims to provide
              working solutions <span class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>; forcing the use of
              Java 5 is not an option in such an important area.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Current metadata APIs, such as Commons Attributes (used by
          Spring 1.0-1.2) are hard to test. Spring provides a simple metadata
          interface that is much easier to mock.</p></li></ul></div><p>The Spring <tt class="literal">Attributes</tt> interface looks like
    this:</p><pre class="programlisting">public interface Attributes {

    Collection getAttributes(Method targetMethod);

    Collection getAttributes(Method targetMethod, Class filter);

    Collection getAttributes(Field targetField);

    Collection getAttributes(Field targetField, Class filter);
}</pre><p>This is a lowest common denominator interface. JSR-175 offers more
    capabilities than this, such as attributes on method arguments. As of
    Spring 1.0, Spring aims to provide the subset of metadata required to
    provide effective declarative enterprise services a la EJB or .NET, on
    Java 1.3+. As of Spring 1.2, analogous JSR-175 annotations are supported
    on JDK 1.5, as direct alternative to Commons Attributes.</p><p>Note that this interface offers <tt class="literal">Object</tt>
    attributes, like .NET. This distinguishes it from attribute systems such
    as that of Nanning Aspects and JBoss 4 (as of DR2), which offer only
    <tt class="literal">String</tt> attributes. There is a significant advantage in
    supporting <tt class="literal">Object</tt> attributes. It enables attributes to
    participate in class hierarchies and enables attributes to react
    intelligently to their configuration parameters.</p><p>In most attribute providers, attribute classes will be configured
    via constructor arguments or JavaBean properties. Commons Attributes
    supports both.</p><p>As with all Spring abstraction APIs, <tt class="literal">Attributes</tt>
    is an interface. This makes it easy to mock attribute implementations for
    unit tests.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="metadata-commons"></a>9.3.&nbsp;Integration with Jakarta Commons Attributes</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Presently Spring supports only Jakarta Commons Attributes out of the

    is a capable attributes solution. It supports attribute configuration via
    constructor arguments and JavaBean properties, which offers better
    self-documentation in attribute definitions. (Support for JavaBean
    properties was added at the request of the Spring team.)</p><p>We've already seen two examples of Commons Attributes attributes
    definitions. In general, we will need to express:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The name of the attribute class</em></span>. This can
        be an FQN, as shown above. If the relevant attribute class has already
        been imported, the FQN isn't required. It's also possible to specify
        "attribute packages" in attribute compiler configuration.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Any necessary parameterization,</em></span> via
        constructor arguments or JavaBean properties</p></li></ul></div><p>Bean properties look as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">/**
 * @@MyAttribute(myBooleanJavaBeanProperty=true)
 */</pre><p>It's possible to combine constructor arguments and JavaBean
    properties (as in Spring IoC).</p><p>Because, unlike Java 1.5 attributes, Commons Attributes is not
    integrated with the Java language, it is necessary to run a special
    <span class="emphasis"><em>attribute compilation</em></span> step as part of the build
    process.</p><p>To run Commons Attributes as part of the build process, you will
    need to do the following.</p><p>1. Copy the necessary library Jars to
    <tt class="literal">$ANT_HOME/lib</tt>. Four Jars are required, and all are
    distributed with Spring:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Commons Attributes compiler Jar and API Jar</p></li><li><p>xjavadoc.jar, from XDoclet</p></li><li><p>commons-collections.jar, from Jakarta Commons</p></li></ul></div><p>2. Import the Commons Attributes ant tasks into your project build
    script, as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;taskdef resource="org/apache/commons/attributes/anttasks.properties"/&gt;</pre><p>3. Next, define an attribute compilation task, which will use the
    Commons Attributes attribute-compiler task to "compile" the attributes in
    the source. This process results in the generation of additional sources,
    to a location specified by the destdir attribute. Here we show the use of
    a temporary directory:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;target name="compileAttributes"&gt;

  &lt;attribute-compiler destdir="${commons.attributes.tempdir}"&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="${src.dir}" includes="**/*.java"/&gt;
  &lt;/attribute-compiler&gt;

&lt;/target&gt;</pre><p>The compile target that runs Javac over the sources should depend on
    this attribute compilation task, and must also compile the generated
    sources, which we output to our destination temporary directory. If there
    are syntax errors in your attribute definitions, they will normally be
    caught by the attribute compiler. However, if the attribute definitions
    are syntactically plausible, but specify invalid types or class names, the
    compilation of the generated attribute classes may fail. In this case, you
    can look at the generated classes to establish the cause of the
    problem.</p><i><span class="remark">Commons Attributes also provides Maven support. Please refer to
    Commons Attributes documentation for further information.</span></i><p>While this attribute compilation process may look complex, in fact
    it's a one-off cost. Once set up, attribute compilation is incremental, so
    it doesn't usually noticeably slow the build process. And once the
    compilation process is set up, you may find that use of attributes as
    described in this chapter can save you a lot of time in other
    areas.</p><p>If you require attribute indexing support (only currently required
    by Spring for attribute-targeted web controllers, discussed below), you
    will need an additional step, which must be performed on a Jar file of
    your compiled classes. In this, optional, step, Commons Attributes will
    create an index of all the attributes defined on your sources, for
    efficient lookup at runtime. This step looks as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;attribute-indexer jarFile="myCompiledSources.jar"&gt;
    
  &lt;classpath refid="master-classpath"/&gt;

&lt;/attribute-indexer&gt;</pre><i><span class="remark">See the /attributes directory of the Spring jPetStore sample
    application for an example of this build process. You can take the build
    script it contains and modify it for your own projects.</span></i><p>If your unit tests depend on attributes, try to express the
    dependency on the Spring Attributes abstraction, rather than Commons
    Attributes. Not only is this more portable--for example, your tests will
    still work if you switch to Java 1.5 attributes in future--it simplifies
    testing. Commons Attributes is a static API, while Spring provides a
    metadata interface that you can easily mock.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="metadata-uses"></a>9.4.&nbsp;Metadata and Spring AOP autoproxying</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>The most important uses of metadata attributes are in conjunction
    with Spring AOP. This provides a .NET-like programming model, where
    declarative services are automatically provided to application objects
    that declare metadata attributes. Such metadata attributes can be
    supported out of the box by the framework, as in the case of declarative
    transaction management, or can be custom.</p><p>There is widely held to be a synergy between AOP and metadata
    attributes.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e6526"></a>9.4.1.&nbsp;Fundamentals</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>This builds on the Spring AOP autoproxy functionality.

&lt;bean class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionAttributeSourceAdvisor"&gt;
  &lt;property name="transactionInterceptor" ref="txInterceptor"/&gt;

    &lt;/bean&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;bean id="attributes" class="org.springframework.metadata.commons.CommonsAttributes"/&gt;</pre><p>The basic concepts here should be familiar from the discussion of
      autoproxying in the AOP chapter.</p><p>The most important bean definitions are those the auto-proxy creator
      and the advisor. Note that the actual bean names are not important;
			what matters is their class.</p><p>The bean definition of class
      <tt class="literal">org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator</tt>
      will automatically advise ("auto-proxy") all bean instances in the
      current factory based on matching Advisor implementations. This class
      knows nothing about attributes, but relies on Advisors' pointcuts
      matching. The pointcuts do know about attributes.</p><p>Thus we simply need an AOP advisor that will provide declarative
      transaction management based on attributes.</p><p>It's possible to add arbitrary custom Advisor implementations as
      well, and they will also be evaluated and applied automatically. (You
      can use Advisors whose pointcuts match on criteria besides attributes in
      the same autoproxy configuration, if necessary.)</p><p>Finally, the <tt class="literal">attributes</tt> bean is the Commons
      Attributes Attributes implementation. Replace with another
      implementation of <tt class="literal">org.springframework.metadata.Attributes
      </tt>to source attributes from a different source.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="metadata-tx"></a>9.4.2.&nbsp;Declarative transaction management</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>The commonest use of source-level attributes it to provide
      declarative transaction management a la .NET. Once the bean definitions
      shown above are in place, you can define any number of application
      objects requiring declarative transactions. Only those classes or
      methods with transaction attributes will be given transaction advice.
      You need to do nothing except define the required transaction
      attributes.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Unlike</em></span> in .NET, you can specify transaction
      attributes at either class or method level. Class-level attributes, if

      class-level attributes. Spring can apply this behavior to any POJO. You
      simply need to specify a pooling attribute, as follows, in the business
      object to be pooled:</p><pre class="programlisting"> /**

public class MyClass {</pre><p>You'll need the usual autoproxy
      infrastructure configuration. You then need to specify a pooling
      <tt class="literal">TargetSourceCreator</tt>, as follows. Because pooling
      affects the creation of the target, we can't use a regular advice. Note
      that pooling will apply even if there are no advisors applicable to the
      class, if that class has a pooling attribute.</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;bean id="poolingTargetSourceCreator"
  class="org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.metadata.AttributesPoolingTargetSourceCreator"&gt;

&lt;/bean&gt;</pre><p>As with the use of metadata in Spring in general, this is a
      one-off cost: once setup is out of the way, it's very easy to use
      pooling for additional business objects.</p><i><span class="remark">It's arguable that the need for pooling is rare, so there's

    is normally A Good Thing. It provides maximum flexibility. In
    particular:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The controller instance is explicitly managed by Spring IoC,
          through an XML bean definition</p></li><li><p>The mapping is external to the controller, so the same

    URL.</span></i><p>In this approach, controllers are marked with one or more
    class-level metadata attributes, each specifying one URL they should be
    mapped to.</p><p>The following examples show the approach. In each case, we have a
    controller that depends on a business object of type Cruncher. As usual,
    this dependency will be resolved by Dependency Injection. The Cruncher
    must be available through a bean definition in the relevant
    DispatcherServlet XML file, or a parent context.</p><p>We attach an attribute to the controller class specifying the URL
    that should map to it. We can express the dependency through a JavaBean
    property or a constructor argument. This dependency must be resolvable by
    autowiring: that is, there must be exactly one business object of type

        concerned.</p></li><li><p>Reliance on automagical IoC resolution may be confusing.</p></li></ul></div><p>Because autowiring by type means there must be exactly one
    dependency of the specified type, we need to be careful if we use AOP. In
    the common case using TransactionProxyFactoryBean, for example, we end up
    with <span class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> implementations of a business interface such
    as Cruncher: the original POJO definition, and the transactional AOP
    proxy. This won't work, as the owning application context can't resolve
    the type dependency unambiguously. The solution is to use AOP
    autoproxying, setting up the autoproxy infrastructure so that there is
    only one implementation of Cruncher defined, and that implementation is
    automatically advised. Thus this approach works well with
    attribute-targeted declarative services as described above. As the
    attributes compilation process must be in place to handle the web
    controller targeting, this is easy to set up.</p><p>Unlike other metadata functionality, there is currently only a
    Commons Attributes implementation available:
    org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.metadata.CommonsPathMapHandlerMapping.
    This limitation is due to the fact that not only do we need attribute
    compilation, we need attribute <span class="emphasis"><em>indexing</em></span>: the ability
    to ask the attributes API for all classes with the PathMap attribute.
    Indexing is not currently offered on the
    <tt class="literal">org.springframework.metadata.Attributes</tt> abstraction
    interface, although it may be in future. (If you want to add support for
    another attributes implementation--which must support indexing--you can
    easily extend the <tt class="literal">AbstractPathMapHandlerMapping</tt>
    superclass of <tt class="literal">CommonsPathMapHandlerMapping</tt>,
    implementing the two protected abstract methods to use your preferred
    attributes API.)</p><p>Thus we need two additional steps in the build process: attribute
    compilation and attribute indexing. Use of the attribute indexer task was
    shown above. Note that Commons Attributes presently requires a Jar file as
    input to indexing.</p><i><span class="remark">If you begin with a handler metadata mapping approach, it is
    possible to switch at any point to a classic Spring XML mapping approach.
    So you don't close off this option. For this reason, I find that I often
    start a web application using metadata mapping.</span></i></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e6729"></a>9.6.&nbsp;Other uses of metadata attributes</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Other uses of metadata attributes appear to be growing in

    easy to do so.</p><p>Simply implement the

    facade for your metadata API. You can then include this object in your
    bean definitions as shown above.</p><p>All framework services that use metadata, such as AOP
    metadata-driven autoproxying, will then automatically be able to use your
