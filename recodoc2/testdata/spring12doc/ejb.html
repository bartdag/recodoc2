  replacement. We do believe that for many if not most applications and use
  cases, Spring as a container, combined with its rich supporting
  functionality in the area of transactions, ORM and JDBC access, is a better
  choice than implementing equivalent functionality via an EJB container and
  EJBs.</p><p>However, it is important to note that using Spring does not prevent
  you from using EJBs. In fact, Spring makes it much easier to access EJBs and
  implement EJBs and functionality within them. Additionally, using Spring to
  access services provided by EJBs allows the implementation of those services
  to later transparently be switched between local EJB, remote EJB, or POJO
  (plain java object) variants, without the client code client code having to
  be changed.</p><p>In this chapter, we look at how Spring can help you access and
  implement EJBs. Spring provides particular value when accessing stateless
  session beans (SLSBs), so we'll begin by discussing this.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ejb-access"></a>17.1.&nbsp;Accessing EJBs</h2></div></div><div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ejb-access-concepts"></a>17.1.1.&nbsp;Concepts</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>To invoke a method on a local or remote stateless session bean,
      client code must normally perform a JNDI lookup to obtain the (local or
      remote) EJB Home object, then use a 'create' method call on that object
      to obtain the actual (local or remote) EJB object. One or more methods
      are then invoked on the EJB.</p><p>To avoid repeated low-level code, many EJB applications use the
      Service Locator and Business Delegate patterns. These are better than
      spraying JNDI lookups throughout client code, but their usual
      implementations have significant disadvantages. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Typically code using EJBs depends on Service Locator or
          Business Delegate singletons, making it hard to test</p></li><li><p>In the case of the Service Locator pattern used without a
          Business Delegate, application code still ends up having to invoke
          the create() method on an EJB home, and deal with the resulting
          exceptions. Thus it remains tied to the EJB API and the complexity
          of the EJB programming model.</p></li><li><p>Implementing the Business Delegate pattern typically results
          in significant code duplication, where we have to write numerous
          methods that simply call the same method on the EJB.</p></li></ul></div><p>The Spring approach is to allow the creation and use of proxy
      objects, normally configured inside a Spring ApplicationContext or
      BeanFactory, which act as code-less business delegates. You do not need
      to write another Service Locator, another JNDI lookup, or duplicate
      methods in a hand-coded Business Delegate unless you&#8217;re adding real
      value.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ejb-access-local"></a>17.1.2.&nbsp;Accessing local SLSBs</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Assume that we have a web controller that needs to use a local
      EJB. We&#8217;ll follow best practice and use the EJB Business Methods
      Interface pattern, so that the EJB&#8217;s local interface extends a non
      EJB-specific business methods interface. Let&#8217;s call this business
      methods interface MyComponent.</p><pre class="programlisting">public interface MyComponent {
    ...
}</pre><p>(One of the main reasons to the Business Methods Interface pattern
      is to ensure that synchronization between method signatures in local
      interface and bean implementation class is automatic. Another reason is
      that it later makes it much easier for us to switch to a POJO (plain
      java object) implementation of the service if it makes sense to do so)
      Of course we&#8217;ll also need to implement the local home interface and
      provide a bean implementation class that implements SessionBean and the
      MyComponent business methods interface. Now the only Java coding we&#8217;ll
      need to do to hook up our web tier controller to the EJB implementation
      is to expose a setter method of type MyComponent on the controller. This
      will save the reference as an instance variable in the
      controller:</p><pre class="programlisting">private MyComponent myComponent;

public void setMyComponent(MyComponent myComponent) {
    this.myComponent = myComponent;
}</pre><p>We can subsequently use this instance variable in any business
      method in the controller. Now assuming we are obtaining our controller
      object out of a Spring ApplicationContext or BeanFactory, we can in the
      same context configure a
      <tt class="literal">LocalStatelessSessionProxyFactoryBean</tt> instance, which
      will be EJB proxy object. The configuration of the proxy, and setting of
      the <tt class="literal">myComponent</tt> property of the controller is done
      with a configuration entry such as:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;bean id="myComponent"
      class="org.springframework.ejb.access.LocalStatelessSessionProxyFactoryBean"&gt;
  &lt;property name="jndiName" value="myComponent"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="businessInterface" value="com.mycom.MyComponent"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;bean id="myController" class="com.mycom.myController"&gt;
  &lt;property name="myComponent" ref="myComponent"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</pre><p>There&#8217;s a lot of magic happening behind the scenes, courtesy of
      the Spring AOP framework, although you aren&#8217;t forced to work with AOP
      concepts to enjoy the results. The <tt class="literal">myComponent</tt> bean
      definition creates a proxy for the EJB, which implements the business
      method interface. The EJB local home is cached on startup, so there&#8217;s
      only a single JNDI lookup. Each time the EJB is invoked, the proxy
      invokes the create() method on the local EJB and invokes the
      corresponding business method on the EJB.</p><p>The <tt class="literal">myController</tt> bean definition sets the
      <tt class="literal">myController</tt> property of the controller class to this
      proxy.</p><p>This EJB access mechanism delivers huge simplification of
      application code: The web tier code (or other EJB client code) has no
      dependence on the use of EJB. If we want to replace this EJB reference
      with a POJO or a mock object or other test stub, we could simply change
      the myComponent bean definition without changing a line of Java code.
      Additionally, we haven&#8217;t had to write a single line of JNDI lookup or
      other EJB plumbing code as part of our application.</p><p>Benchmarks and experience in real applications indicate that the
      performance overhead of this approach (which involves reflective
      invocation of the target EJB) is minimal, and undetectable in typical
      use. Remember that we don&#8217;t want to make fine-grained calls to EJBs
      anyway, as there&#8217;s a cost associated with the EJB infrastructure in the
      application server.</p><p>There is one caveat with regards to the JNDI lookup. In a bean
      container, this class is normally best used as a singleton (there simply
      is no reason to make it a prototype). However, if that bean container
      pre-instantiates singletons (as do the XML ApplicationContext variants)
      you may have a problem if the bean container is loaded before the EJB
      container loads the target EJB. That is because the JNDI lookup will be
      performed in the init method of this class and cached, but the EJB will
      not have been bound at the target location yet. The solution is to not
      pre-instantiate this factory object, but allow it to be created on first
      use. In the XML containers, this is controlled via the
      <tt class="literal">lazy-init</tt> attribute.</p><p>Although this will not be of interest to the majority of Spring
      users, those doing programmatic AOP work with EJBs may want to look at
      <tt class="literal">LocalSlsbInvokerInterceptor</tt>.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ejb-access-remote"></a>17.1.3.&nbsp;Accessing remote SLSBs</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Accessing remote EJBs is essentially identical to accessing local
      EJBs, except that the
      <tt class="literal">SimpleRemoteStatelessSessionProxyFactoryBean</tt> is used.
      Of course, with or without Spring, remote invocation semantics apply; a
      call to a method on an object in another VM in another computer does
      sometimes have to be treated differently in terms of usage scenarios and
      failure handling.</p><p>Spring's EJB client support adds one more advantage over the
      non-Spring approach. Normally it is problematic for EJB client code to
      be easily switched back and forth between calling EJBs locally or
      remotely. This is because the remote interface methods must declare that
      they throw <tt class="literal">RemoteException</tt>, and client code must deal
      with this, while the local interface methods don't. Client code
      written for local EJBs which needs to be moved to remote EJBs
      typically has to be modified to add handling for the remote exceptions,
      and client code written for remote EJBs which needs to be moved to local
      EJBs, can either stay the same but do a lot of unnecessary handling of
      remote exceptions, or needs to be modified to remove that code. With the
      Spring remote EJB proxy, you can instead not declare any thrown
      <tt class="literal">RemoteException</tt> in your Business Method Interface and
      implementing EJB code, have a remote interface which is identical except
      that it does throw <tt class="literal">RemoteException</tt>, and rely on the
      proxy to dynamically treat the two interfaces as if they were the same.
      That is, client code does not have to deal with the checked
      <tt class="literal">RemoteException</tt> class. Any actual
      <tt class="literal">RemoteException</tt> that is thrown during the EJB
      invocation will be re-thrown as the non-checked
      <tt class="literal">RemoteAccessException</tt> class, which is a subclass of
      <tt class="literal">RuntimeException</tt>. The target service can then be
      switched at will between a local EJB or remote EJB (or even plain Java
      object) implementation, without the client code knowing or caring. Of
      course, this is optional; there is nothing stopping you from declaring
      <tt class="literal">RemoteExceptions</tt> in your business interface.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ejb-implementation"></a>17.2.&nbsp;Using Spring convenience EJB implementation classes</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Spring also provides convenience classes to help you implement EJBs.
    These are designed to encourage the good practice of putting business
    logic behind EJBs in POJOs, leaving EJBs responsible for transaction
    demarcation and (optionally) remoting.</p><p>To implement a Stateless or Stateful session bean, or Message Driven
    bean, you derive your implementation class from
    <tt class="literal">AbstractStatelessSessionBean</tt>,
    <tt class="literal">AbstractStatefulSessionBean</tt>, and
    <tt class="literal">AbstractMessageDrivenBean</tt>/<tt class="literal">AbstractJmsMessageDrivenBean</tt>,
    respectively.</p><p>Consider an example Stateless Session bean which actually delegates
    the implementation to a plain java service object. We have the business
    interface:</p><pre class="programlisting">public interface MyComponent {
    public void myMethod(...);
    ...
}</pre><p>We have the plain java implementation object:</p><pre class="programlisting">public class MyComponentImpl implements MyComponent {
    public String myMethod(...) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}</pre><p>And finally the Stateless Session Bean itself:</p><pre class="programlisting">public class MyComponentEJB extends AbstractStatelessSessionBean
        implements MyComponent {

    MyComponent _myComp;

    /**
     * Obtain our POJO service object from the BeanFactory/ApplicationContext
     * @see org.springframework.ejb.support.AbstractStatelessSessionBean#onEjbCreate()
     */
    protected void onEjbCreate() throws CreateException {
        _myComp = (MyComponent) getBeanFactory().getBean(
            ServicesConstants.CONTEXT_MYCOMP_ID);
    }

    // for business method, delegate to POJO service impl.
    public String myMethod(...) {
        return _myComp.myMethod(...);
    }
    ...
}</pre><p>The Spring EJB support base classes will by default create and load
    a BeanFactory (or in this case, its ApplicationContext subclass) as part
    of their lifecycle, which is then available to the EJB (for example, as
    used in the code above to obtain the POJO service object). The loading is
    done via a strategy object which is a subclass of
    <tt class="literal">BeanFactoryLocator</tt>. The actual implementation of
    <tt class="literal">BeanFactoryLocator</tt> used by default is
    <tt class="literal">ContextJndiBeanFactoryLocator</tt>, which creates the
    ApplicationContext from a resource locations specified as a JNDI
    environment variable (in the case of the EJB classes, at
    <tt class="literal">java:comp/env/ejb/BeanFactoryPath</tt>). If there is a need
    to change the BeanFactory/ApplicationContext loading strategy, the default
    <tt class="literal">BeanFactoryLocator</tt> implementation used may be overridden
    by calling the <tt class="literal">setBeanFactoryLocator()</tt> method, either
    in <tt class="literal">setSessionContext()</tt>, or in the actual constructor of
    the EJB. Please see the JavaDocs for more details.</p><p>As described in the JavaDocs, Stateful Session beans expecting to be
    passivated and reactivated as part of their lifecycle, and which use a
    non-serializable BeanFactory/ApplicationContext instance (which is the
    normal case) will have to manually call
    <tt class="literal">unloadBeanFactory()</tt> and
    <tt class="literal">loadBeanFactory</tt> from <tt class="literal">ejbPassivate</tt>
    and <tt class="literal">ejbActivate</tt>, respectively, to unload and reload the
    BeanFactory on passivation and activation, since it can not be saved by
    the EJB container.</p><p>The default usage of
    <tt class="literal">ContextJndiBeanFactoryLocator</tt> to load an
    ApplicationContext for the use of the EJB is adequate for some situations.
    However, it is problematic when the ApplicationContext is loading a number
    of beans, or the initialization of those beans is time consuming or memory
    intensive (such as a Hibernate SessionFactory initialization, for
    example), since every EJB will have their own copy. In this case, the user
    may want to override the default
    <tt class="literal">ContextJndiBeanFactoryLocator</tt> usage and use another
    <tt class="literal">BeanFactoryLocator </tt>variant, such as
    <tt class="literal">ContextSingleton<tt class="literal">BeanFactoryLocator</tt>e</tt>,
    which can load and use a shared BeanFactory or ApplicationContext to be
    used by multiple EJBs or other clients. Doing this is relatively simple,
    by adding code similar to this to the EJB:</p><pre class="programlisting">   /**
    * Override default BeanFactoryLocator implementation
    * 
    * @see javax.ejb.SessionBean#setSessionContext(javax.ejb.SessionContext)
    */
   public void setSessionContext(SessionContext sessionContext) {
       super.setSessionContext(sessionContext);
       setBeanFactoryLocator(ContextSingletonBeanFactoryLocator.getInstance());
       setBeanFactoryLocatorKey(ServicesConstants.PRIMARY_CONTEXT_ID);
   }</pre><p>Please see the respective JavaDocs for
    <tt class="literal">BeanFactoryLocator</tt> and
    <tt class="literal">ContextSingleton<tt class="literal">BeanFactoryLocator</tt>e</tt>
    for more information on their usage.</p><p></p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="remoting.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="jms.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;16.&nbsp;Remoting and web services using Spring&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;18.&nbsp;JMS</td></tr></table></div>
