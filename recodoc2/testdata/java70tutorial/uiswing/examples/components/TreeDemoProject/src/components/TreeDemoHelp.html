<h1>Tree Demo</h1>

This is the help file (<code>TreeDemoHelp.html</code>)
for the tree demo.
Selecting any branch node in the tree results 
in this file being displayed.
When you select a leaf node (a book),
this pane displays an HTML file for that book.

<p>
This demo uses a split pane
to separate the tree and this HTML view.
Drag the divider up or down to change the space distribution.
