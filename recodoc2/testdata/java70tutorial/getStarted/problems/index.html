<strong>Common Error Messages on Microsoft Windows Systems</strong>

                <p><code><strong>'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
                operable program or batch file</strong></code>  
    
                <p>If you receive this error,
                Windows
                cannot find the compiler (<code>javac</code>).
                <p>Here's one way to tell
                Windows
                where to find <code>javac</code>.
                Suppose you installed the JDK in
                <code>C:\jdk6</code>.
                At the prompt you would type the following command and press
                 Enter:

C:\jdk6\bin\javac HelloWorldApp.java

                If you choose this option, 
                 you'll have to precede your <code>javac</code>
                and <code>java</code> commands with
                <code>C:\jdk6\bin\</code> each time you compile or run a program.
                To avoid this extra typing, consult
                the section
 in the JDK 6 installation instructions.

<P>
<code><strong>Class names, 'HelloWorldApp', are only accepted if annotation processing is explicitly requested
</strong></code>
<P>

If you receive this error, you forgot to include the <code>.java</code> suffix when 
compiling the program. Remember, the command is <code>javac HelloWorldApp.java</code> not <code>javac HelloWorldApp</code>.

                <code>/usr/local/jdk6</code>.
                At the prompt you would type the following command and press
                 Return:

/usr/local/jdk6/javac HelloWorldApp.java

                <b>Note: </b>If you choose this option, each time you compile

                <code>/usr/local/jdk6/</code>.
                To avoid this extra typing, you could add this information
to your PATH variable. The steps for doing so will vary depending on
which shell you are currently running.

<p>
<strong>Syntax Errors (All Platforms)</strong>
<p>

If you mistype part of a program,
the compiler may issue a <em>syntax</em> error.
The message usually displays the type of the error,
the line number where the error was detected,
the code on that line,
and the position of the error within the code.
Here's an error caused by omitting a semicolon (<code>;</code>)
at the end of a statement:


testing.java:14: `;' expected.
System.out.println("Input has " + count + " chars.")
                                                     ^
1 error


Sometimes the compiler can't guess your intent
and prints a confusing error message
or multiple error messages if the error cascades over several lines.
For example, the following code snippet omits a semicolon (<code>;</code>)
from the bold line:


while (System.in.read() != -1)
    <b>count++</b>
System.out.println("Input has " + count + " chars."); 


When processing this code, the compiler issues two error messages:


testing.java:13: Invalid type expression.
        count++
                 ^
testing.java:14: Invalid declaration.
    System.out.println("Input has " + count + " chars.");
                      ^
2 errors


The compiler issues two error messages
because after it processes <code>count++</code>,
the compiler's state indicates
that it's in the middle of an expression.
Without the semicolon,
the compiler has no way of knowing
that the statement is complete. 
<p>
If you see any compiler errors,
then your program did not successfully compile,
and the compiler did not create a <code>.class</code> file.
Carefully verify the program,
fix any errors that you detect,
and try again. 

<p>

<strong>Semantic Errors</strong>
<p>

In addition to verifying that your program is syntactically correct,
the compiler checks for other basic correctness.
For example, the compiler warns you each time you use a variable
that has not been initialized:


testing.java:13: Variable count may not have been initialized.
        count++
        ^
testing.java:14: Variable count may not have been initialized.
    System.out.println("Input has " + count + " chars.");
                                       ^
2 errors


Again, your program did not successfully compile,
and the compiler did not create a <code>.class</code> file.
Fix the error and try again.

<p><b><code>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
                    HelloWorldApp</code></b>
                    </p>
                  <p>If you receive this error, <code>java</code> cannot find
                    your bytecode file, <code>HelloWorldApp.class</code>.
                    </p>
                  <p>One of the places <code>java</code> tries to find your <CODE>.class</CODE>
                    file is your current directory.
                    So if your <CODE>.class</CODE> file is in
                    <code>C:\java</code>,
                    you should change
                    your current directory to that. To change your directory,
                    type the following command at the prompt and press
                     Enter:
                    </p>

cd c:\java


<p>The prompt should change to <code>C:\java></code>.
                    If you enter <code>dir</code>
                    at the prompt, you should see your <code>.java</code> and
                    <code>.class</code> files. Now enter <code>java HelloWorldApp</code>
                    again. </p>
                  <p>If you still have problems, you might have to change your
                    CLASSPATH variable. To see if this is necessary, try clobbering
                    the classpath with the following command.
                    </p>

set CLASSPATH=

                  <p>
                  Now enter <code>java HelloWorldApp</code> again. If the program
                  works now, you'll have to change your CLASSPATH variable. To set this variable, consult the


section
 in the JDK 6 installation instructions. The CLASSPATH variable is set in the same manner.</p>




<P>

<CODE><STRONG>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: HelloWorldApp/class
</STRONG></CODE>

<p>
A common mistake made by beginner programmers
is to try and run the <code>java</code> launcher on the <code>.class</code> file
that was created by the compiler.
For example, you'll get this error if you try to run your program with
 <code>java HelloWorldApp.class</code>
 instead of <code>java HelloWorldApp</code>.
Remember, the argument is
the <em>name of the class</em>
that you want to use,
<em>not</em> the filename.

<P>

<strong><code>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main</code></strong>
<p>
The Java VM requires
that the class you execute with it
have a <code>main</code> method
at which
to begin execution of your application.
