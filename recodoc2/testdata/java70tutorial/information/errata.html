<h2>First Printing</h2>
These errors are corrected in the 4th printing.
<ul>
<li>CD problems on Linux:
<p>
Some Linux systems automount the CD with a filesystem that forces all
file names to lower case.  This will break browser links to HTML files
with mixed-case names, and also prevent the examples from compiling.
<p>
If you have this problem, try manually mounting the CD with the UDF
filesystem.  To do this:
<ul>
    <li>Become superuser.
    <li>Unmount the cd:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
umount <i>cd_device_path</i>
</pre></div>
    <li>Remount the the cd using the UDF filesystem:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
mount -t udf <i>cd_device_path cd_mount_point</i>
</pre></div>
</ul>

<li>Chapter 1: Getting Started, page 3:
<p>
The source code inside figure 1.2 is missing a closing bracket to 
end the class definition.
<p>
The missing bracket appears in bold below:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
<STRONG>}</STRONG>
</pre></div>
<p>
Thanks to the anonymous reader who reported this!
<hr>
<li> Chapter 3: Language Basics, page 59:
<p>
Typo fix: In the following sentence, the word "operand" (shown in bold) was mistakenly printed as "operator":
<P>
"The equality and relational operators determine if one <strong>operand</strong> is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to another operand."

<p>
Thanks to Dirk Henrici for reporting this!
<hr>
<li> Chapter 4: Classes and Objects, pages 89 and 116:
<P>
In the <code>Bicycle</code> class, the <code>getspeed()</code> method should be called 
<code>getSpeed()</code>.
</li>
<hr>
<li> Chapter 4: Classes and Objects, page 97:
<P>
In the example in the second paragraph, getX and getY should be changed to getX() and getY() so that the 3rdand 4th lines 
in the example read:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
circle.setX(circle.getX() + deltaX);
circle.setY(circle.getY() + deltaY);
</pre></div>
Thanks to Laslo Vukovitch for reporting this.

</li>
<hr>
<li> Chapter 4: Classes and Objects, page 107:
<P>
In the <code>SeeWhosFastest()</code> method, the method should be called 
<code>seeWhosFastest()</code>.
</li>
<hr>
<li> Chapter 4: Classes and Objects, page 114:
<P>
The last word in the Note should be changed from "variables" to "methods" so that the sentence reads:

"You can also refer to static methods with an object reference like instanceName.methodName(args) but 
this is discouraged because it does not make it clear that they are class methods."

</li>
<hr>
<li> Chapter 5: Interfaces and Inheritance, page 145:
<P>
The code "if ( (obj1)isLargerThan(obj2)) ..." should be changed to "if ( (obj1)isLargerThan(obj2) ..." 
in three places by removing the extra parenthesis, ). The three lines should read:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
if ( (obj1)isLargerThan(obj2) &gt; 0);
if ( (obj1)isLargerThan(obj2) &lt; 0);
if ( (obj1)isLargerThan(obj2) == 0);
</pre></div>
Thanks to Clare Murnaghan for catching this.

</li>
<hr>
<li> Chapter 8: Numbers and Strings, page 200:
<P>
In the title for Table 8.3, the file name should be <code>TestFormat.java</code>.
<p>
</li>
<hr>
<li> Chapter 8: Numbers and Strings, page 208:
<P>
In the Random Numbers section:
<ol>
<li>
in the 4th line, change the sentence to read: "For example, to generate an integer 
between 0 and 9."
</li>
<li>
change the code in line 6 to read <code>
     int number = (int)(Math.random() * 10);</code>
</li>
<li>
in line 8, remove the entire sentence that begins "The compiler boxes...."
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thanks to Serge Abrashevich for pointing this out.

</li>

<hr>
<li> Chapter 8: Numbers and Strings, page 223:
<P>
In the picture, change substring(sep, dot) to substring(sep + 1, dot)
<p>
Thanks to Tomec Czechowski for pointing this out.

</li>

<hr>
<li>Chapter 3: Language Basics, page 80:
<p>
The second paragraph from the bottom reads:

To see this effect more clearly, try removing the <code>continue</code>
statement and recompiling.  When you run the program again, the count
will be wrong, saying that it found <b>44</b> p's instead of 9.

In fact, when you run the program again, the count is <b>35</b>.
<p>
Thanks to Cesar Siqueira for being the first to report this error!
<hr>

<li>Chapter 17: Java Web Start, page 525:
<p>
The footnote takes you to the wrong URL.  The correct URL is:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
docs/books/tutorialJWS/deployment/webstart/examples/Notepad.jnlp
</pre></div>

<hr>
<li>Chapter 17: Java Web Start, page 526:
<p>
This is an older JNLP file and needs to be slightly modified to use release 6.
<p>
The <code>codebase</code> line should read:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
codebase = "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/
            tutorialJWS/deployment/webstart/<b>examples</b>/"
href="Notepad.jnlp"&gt;
</pre></div>
and the <code>j2se</code> version should read:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
&lt;j2se version="<b>1.6+</b>"
      href="http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se"/&gt;
</pre></div>
Thanks to Ian Davis for catching this!

<li>Appendix A<P>
There is a clarification to the descriptive text above the keyword list. 
<P>
Previous text:

"Here's a list of keywords in the Java language. These words are reserved &mdash; you cannot use any of these words as names in your programs. <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>null</code> are not keywords but they are reserved words, so you cannot use them as names in your programs either."


<P>
Clarified text:

"Here's a list of keywords in the Java programming language. You cannot use any of the following as identifiers in your programs. The keywords <code>const</code> and <code>goto</code> are reserved, even though they are not currently used. <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>null</code> might seem like keywords, but they are actually literals; you cannot use them as identifiers in your programs."





</ul>
